# SatsPath Implementations

This document maps the SatsPath Protocol v1 specification to the current repository implementation.

The implementation must be understood as a protocol stack, not as a single P2P system. P2P is one transport implementation among several.

## Repository Layout

```txt
crates/satspath-core      protocol data types, signatures, resolvers, validation
crates/satspath-router    quote response contract and route selection
crates/satspath-cli       command-line reference client
crates/satspathd          local daemon and HTTP API
docs/                     protocol and operational documentation
```

## Core Protocol Types

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspath-core/src/profile.rs
```

Spec mapping:

| Spec object               | Rust type                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `PaymentProfile`          | `PaymentProfile`           |
| `SignedPaymentProfile`    | `SignedPaymentProfile`     |
| `PaymentMethod.Lightning` | `PaymentMethod::Lightning` |
| `PaymentMethod.Onchain`   | `PaymentMethod::Onchain`   |
| `PaymentMethod.Ark`       | `PaymentMethod::Ark`       |
| Invite                    | `Invite`, `InviteRecord`   |

## Signature and Safety Validation

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspath-core/src/crypto.rs
crates/satspath-core/src/validation.rs
```

Responsibilities:

- Generate protocol identity keypairs.
- Sign public profiles.
- Verify signed profiles.
- Compute identity fingerprints.
- Reject malformed public keys.
- Reject private material in public protocol objects.
- Validate Lightning addresses, Bitcoin addresses, Ark URLs, and compressed pubkeys.

Protocol identity keys are not wallet spending keys.

## Resolver Implementations

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspath-core/src/resolver.rs
crates/satspath-core/src/resolvers/
crates/satspath-core/src/registry.rs
crates/satspath-core/src/peer_registry.rs
```

Current resolver surfaces:

| Resolver            | File                               | Status                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local registry      | `registry.rs`                      | Active                                                                    |
| Local peer registry | `peer_registry.rs`                 | Active local storage                                                      |
| BIP-353             | `resolvers/bip353.rs`, `bip353.rs` | Resolver and DNS primitives; strict DNSSEC fails closed without validator |
| HTTPS               | `resolvers/http.rs`                | Active                                                                    |
| Nostr               | `resolvers/nostr.rs`               | Active NIP-05 + kind 30078 resolver                                       |
| Platform            | `resolvers/platform.rs`            | Scaffold                                                                  |

Resolver chain behavior is implemented by `ChainResolver`.

## Quote Response and Routing

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspath-router/src/quote_response.rs
crates/satspath-router/src/router.rs
crates/satspath-router/src/fees.rs
crates/satspath-router/src/lightning.rs
```

Spec mapping:

| Spec behavior         | Implementation                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Resolve identifier    | `quote_inner` + `ProfileResolver`        |
| Verify profile        | `verify_signed_profile`                  |
| Check expiry          | `check_profile_expiry`                   |
| Select route          | `select_route`, `select_route_with_fees` |
| Build payment payload | `build_qr_payload`                       |
| Stable response       | `QuoteResponse`                          |

`QuoteResponse` status values:

```txt
ok
not_registered
no_route
invalid_signature
```

These values are the UI and API contract.

## Daemon Implementation

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspathd/src/main.rs
```

The daemon exposes the protocol over a local HTTP API:

| Endpoint                   | Purpose                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`              | Liveness                                      |
| `GET /v1/status`           | Local daemon/protocol status                  |
| `GET /v1/node`             | Aggregate status, profile, peers, connections |
| `GET /v1/profile`          | Local wallet profile state                    |
| `PUT/POST /v1/profile`     | Create or update local public profile         |
| `POST /v1/profile/methods` | Update receive methods                        |
| `POST /v1/resolve`         | Resolve a local profile                       |
| `POST /v1/quote`           | Protocol quote response                       |
| `POST /v1/pay`             | Wallet handoff using protocol quote response  |
| `POST /v1/dns/resolve`     | BIP-353/DNS resolution                        |

`/v1/pay` does not move funds. It returns a wallet handoff containing a public payment payload and QR SVG.

## CLI Implementation

Implemented in:

```txt
crates/satspath-cli/src/
```

Important commands:

| Command area         | Protocol role                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `register`           | Create signed public profile         |
| `wallet`             | Manage local receive profile         |
| `quote`              | Produce quote response               |
| `pay`                | Preview/handoff flow                 |
| `dns`                | BIP-353 resolver tooling             |
| `peer export/import` | Manual transport for signed profiles |

The CLI is a reference client for local development and protocol testing.

## P2P Transport Implementation

Documented in:

```txt
docs/wire_p2p.md
```

This specification defines an optional transport. It publishes and resolves signed profiles over Pear/Holepunch. It must be treated as a resolver transport, not the whole protocol.

Conformance requirements:

- Return `SignedPaymentProfile` objects.
- Verify before import or route use.
- Never treat peer connectivity as profile ownership.
- Never carry wallet private material.

Wire behavior is documented in [wire_p2p.md](./wire_p2p.md).

## Current Gaps

Known v1 implementation gaps:

- DNSSEC strict mode needs a local DNSSEC-validating resolver to fully trust BIP-353 on mainnet.
- Nostr publishing is not yet exposed as a Rust CLI command; use a Nostr client to publish the kind 30078 event. Platform resolvers are scaffolds.
- Resolver provenance is not yet carried through `ProfileResolver`, so signed-profile quote responses mark `identifier_verified: false` unless a direct BIP-353 preview provides DNSSEC validation.
- Mainnet payment execution is intentionally not implemented.
- P2P wire envelopes should be formalized in the SDK to match [wire_p2p.md](./wire_p2p.md).
- Method ownership proofs exist in core but need broader resolver integration.

## Conformance Checklist

An implementation in this repo should be considered conformant when it:

- Uses `SignedPaymentProfile` for receiver data.
- Verifies signatures before routing.
- Applies expiry checks.
- Rejects unsafe private material.
- Produces the four-status `QuoteResponse`.
- Keeps resolver transports separate from protocol verification.
- Treats Pear/Holepunch as optional transport.
- Returns wallet handoff data instead of executing mainnet payments.
