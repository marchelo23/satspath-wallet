# Mainnet Safety & Security Guidelines

SatsPath is a powerful routing engine that coordinates interactions across multiple Bitcoin layers (Lightning, On-chain, and Ark). Moving real funds on Mainnet carries inherent risks. This document establishes the security perimeter for the engine.

## 1. Non-Custodial Architecture

**SatsPath is NOT a custodial wallet.**

- The `Identity Key` (used to sign profiles) **does not** control funds.
- Wallet, Node, or SDK plugins are responsible for securely managing funds and signing transactions.
- Never store seed phrases, wallet private keys, macaroons, certs, API tokens, or other high-value secrets in the SatsPath repository or plaintext config files.
- Email verification proves inbox access only. It does not transfer custody and
  does not prove ownership of a Gmail-style domain.
- Receiver wallets must generate private keys locally on the receiver's device
  and publish only public payment profiles.

## 2. Mainnet Preview vs Mainnet Execution

### Mainnet Preview

Mainnet Preview is allowed because it touches public data only:

- signed public payment profiles,
- public identity keys,
- public Lightning Address / LNURL metadata,
- BOLT11 invoice strings when explicitly requested,
- public on-chain addresses,
- BIP21 `bitcoin:` URIs,
- public Ark server and receiver pubkey pointers,
- route quotes and fee estimates,
- QR/payment pointer display.

Mainnet Preview does not move funds. It does not sign transactions, broadcast
transactions, execute swaps, create/send Ark VTXOs, offboard/onboard, or touch
wallet private keys.

### Mainnet Execution

Mainnet execution is not implemented. No CLI flag exists for it. Any future
mainnet execution feature must be a separate audited change with stronger
confirmation gates and secret-storage controls.

The safe commands are preview commands:

```bash
satspath preview <recipient> <amount_sats> --mainnet
satspath preview <recipient> <amount_sats> --mainnet --json
satspath quote <recipient> <amount_sats> --mainnet-preview --json
```

`pay --mainnet-preview` is a preview screen only. It is not a payment sender.

## 3. Mainnet Configuration

By default, the SatsPath Swap Engine operates in **Testnet mode**.

**Required Safety Defaults:**

- `mainnet_enabled = false`
- `max_mainnet_payment_sats = 1000`
- `require_manual_confirmation = true`
- `fail_closed = true`

Mainnet preview is allowed because it touches public data only. Mainnet
execution is disabled. `--experimental-swaps --testnet` is for testnet-only
engine scaffolding; mainnet execution requires a separate future feature with
stronger confirmation gates.

## 4. Strict Pre-Execution Checks

Before executing _any_ Mainnet transaction or Swap, the engine MUST abort if any of the following checks fail:

- **Amount Mismatch:** Abort if the requested invoice amount does not match the BOLT11 invoice returned by LNURL or Boltz.
- **Signature Verification:** Abort if the `SignedPaymentProfile` signature is invalid or tampered with.
- **Metadata Invalid:** Abort if LNURL metadata violates expected tags or amount bounds.
- **Expiration:** Abort if the payment profile has expired.

## 5. First Mainnet Tests

When testing features on Mainnet for the first time:

- Use tiny amounts only (e.g., `< 1000 sats`).
- Verify routing paths locally before broadcasting.
- Ensure that the local `.satspath/swaps.enc` vault is encrypting secrets via AES-GCM and not falling back silently to plaintext.

## 5. BIP-353 DNS Resolution (Mainnet Preview)

BIP-353 resolution is a **preview** layer: SatsPath resolves and displays
DNSSEC-backed payment instructions but never pays, signs, or broadcasts.

- **DNSSEC is mandatory.** The default `Strict` policy fails closed and does not
  trust an upstream resolver's AD bit. `DevInsecure` mode is local-testing only,
  requires `--allow-insecure-dns-for-dev`, and prints a loud warning.
- **Ambiguity is invalid.** More than one `bitcoin:` TXT record at a name, or an
  unknown `req-*` parameter, makes resolution fail.
- **No private material** may ever appear in a published or resolved DNS payload
  (`seed`, `xprv`/`tprv`, `mnemonic`, `macaroon`, `cert`, `api_key`, `claim_key`,
  `refund_key`, `preimage`, …) — screened on both publish and resolve.
- **Record authorization relies on DNSSEC validation while signed profile verification remains mandatory.** DNSSEC cryptographically authorizes the DNS record, while the signed profile, including its secp256k1 identity-key signature, alias equality, and payment-method validation, remains strictly required for profile-based payments. Email access alone never authorizes a payment-instruction change.
- **Consumer email domains** (e.g. `gmail.com`) cannot use BIP-353; they fall back
  to platform verification / the invite flow.
- **DNS-provider credentials are never committed** — only a trait + mock publisher
  ship in this repo.
