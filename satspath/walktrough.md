# SatsPath Engine — Walkthrough

## What SatsPath Is

SatsPath is a robust backend engine, protocol daemon (`satspathd`), and CLI designed to act as a universal signed payment resolver and router.
It is intended to be embedded into existing wallets (via WASM or FFI) or run as a standalone service, acting as the "brain" for resolving identity profiles and optimizing payment routing.

It can:

- Resolve a local or peer-registered signed profile via multiple resolution methods (Local Registry, BIP-353 DNS, HTTP Well-Known, Nostr).
- Select an optimal payment rail (Lightning, On-chain, Ark) based on live mempool fees and routing rules.
- Authenticate and verify hybrid Post-Quantum signatures (ML-DSA-65 + Schnorr).
- Fetch real LNURL invoices and BOLT12 offers.
- Evaluate Silent Payments (BIP-352) and build BIP-21 on-chain URIs.
- Preview swap directives (testnet only).

It cannot (and intentionally does not):

- Move funds automatically.
- Sign Bitcoin transactions (no PSBT signing).
- Broadcast anything to the network.
- Store or generate seed phrases.
- Execute mainnet swaps.

## Architecture

The project has been pruned into a minimal, standalone backend ecosystem focused purely on Rust (`crates/`), Cloudflare workers (`proxy-workers/`), and integration SDKs.

- **`satspath-core`**: Core models, profile definition, identity keys (ECDSA/Schnorr/PQC), local registry, and resolvers (BIP-353, Nostr, HTTP).
- **`satspath-router`**: The routing engine that queries live fees (with redundant oracles like mempool.space and mempool.ninja) and selects the best payment path.
- **`satspath-pqc`**: Hybrid cryptographic suite combining classical signatures with ML-DSA-65.
- **`satspathd`**: The standalone SatsPath daemon. It features zero-configuration authentication (auto-generating an `admin.macaroon` token) and a secure API middleware.
- **`satspath-wasm`**: WASM bindings that allow embedding the SatsPath resolver and router into frontend applications.
- **`satspath-cli`**: Command-line interface for human-readable interactions (ASCII QR codes, profile management, JSON quoting).
- **`satspath-swaps`**: Experimental scaffold for Boltz Exchange v2 swap integration (testnet intent preview only).

## Security and Cryptography

SatsPath is built with a strict Zero-Trust model:

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Uses a hybrid signature scheme (`ML-DSA-65-Schnorr`) for generating and verifying identity keys. The engine validates that keys and signatures conform to these robust standards, while keeping execution times in the microsecond range.
- **SSRF Protection:** Resolvers strictly validate URLs and block loopback, private, and internal metadata IP ranges (e.g., `169.254.169.254`) to prevent malicious profile endpoints from exploiting internal networks.
- **Nostr Concurrency & Tombstoning:** Downloads profiles from multiple Nostr relays concurrently to ensure the most recent sequence is used, effectively preventing downgrade attacks. It strictly rejects revoked (tombstoned) profiles.
- **Safe Persistence:** All local state (`.satspath/`) uses SHA-256 keyed storage. Sensitive swap material is stored using AES-256-GCM encryption, and plaintext writing is strictly guarded against.

## Supported Payment Rails

1. **Lightning Network:** Selected for smaller amounts (< 100k sats). It handles LNURL-pay two-step fetches and parses BOLT11 invoices to verify amounts.
2. **On-chain:** Selected for larger amounts when fees are acceptable. Includes support for Silent Payments (`sp1...` keys) which are seamlessly integrated into the generated `bitcoin:` URIs.
3. **Ark:** Fallback for when fees are high. Provides Ark payment pointers. (Client-side DAG validation is delegated to the integrating wallet).
4. **BOLT12:** An HTTP proxy scaffold (`proxy-workers/bolt12`) is available to resolve BOLT12 offers to real BOLT11 invoices asynchronously when native LNURL is unavailable.

## Getting Started (Dockerized Environment)

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to quickly launch and auto-configure the `satspathd` daemon via a lightweight Multi-Stage Build, making it trivial to deploy a trusted local registry node.

```bash
make build
make up
make logs
```
